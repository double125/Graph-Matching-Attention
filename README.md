# Graph-Matching-Attention

This code provides a pytorch implementation of our Graph Matching Attention method for Visual Question Answering as described in [Bilateral Cross-Modality Graph Matching Attention for Feature Fusion in Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07270.pdf)

Our Papers: 
《[Bilateral Cross-Modality Graph Matching Attention for Feature Fusion in Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07270.pdf)》

This is the first version of the code of Graph Matching Attention.

TODO:
1. The note of VQA & GQA dataset process
2. Result Table (which can find in our paper)
3. Trained models release.
4. Other details.
